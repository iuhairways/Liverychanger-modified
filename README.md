# Liverychanger-modified
custom liverychanger. ariakim taiyo wrote the code but i changed the liveries and made it work in 3.35 new version.

**How to contribute liveries:**<br>
> Download the plain texture map at map.jpg,<br>
> Use an image editor (like photoshop) to paint your livery onto the aircraft,<br>
> Export the texture file in the original resolution (4096px X 4096 px),<br>
> Upload the file to https://i.ibb.co,<br>
> look at the example on issue #2.<br>
> right now you can only contribute to the 737-700
